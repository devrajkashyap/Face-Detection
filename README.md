# Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python program that uses OpenCV library to detect faces in real-time using a camera feed. The program detects faces and labels them as "person" if a face is found, and displays "No face detected" if no face is found.

## Usage

Run the program by executing the following command:

```shell
python face_detection.py
```

The program will open a window displaying the camera feed. It will detect faces in real-time and draw rectangles around each detected face. If a face is detected, it will be labeled as "person" inside the rectangle. If no face is detected, it will display "No face detected" on the screen.

Press the 'q' key to quit the program.

## Acknowledgments

- The face detection algorithm used in this program is based on the OpenCV library.
- The pre-trained face cascade classifier used for face detection is from the OpenCV project.

## CodeClause AI Internship

This repository is part of the CodeClause AI Internship program. It demonstrates the implementation of face detection using OpenCV. The program detects faces in real-time and labels them as "person" or displays "No face detected" if no face is found.
